Install:
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
Set the "0 speed dosh amount" field to whatever value you want.  When a 
player has at least that amount of dosh, their speed will be 0.  The 
player's speed will decrease linearly as he approaches that limit.

If you want to recieve periodic updates for your current speed, you check 
the "Display player speed" box.  Everytime your dosh amount changes, you 
will recieve a message indicating your new speed.

*IMPORTANT*
This mutator is designed to work with Marco's ServerPerks mutator.  You 
can download that mutator from the TWI forum thread:
